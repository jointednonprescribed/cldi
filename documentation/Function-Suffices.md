# Function Suffices and Their Implied Meaning

## Extended ('Ex'):
	Extra arguments are taken and extra control is given. These functions are commonly the more "base" form and would sometimes be called directly by the other, more straight-forward functions.

## Default Access ('D'):
	If any security-based or access-based control is given by the default version of the
	function through it's arguments, this variant would imply that argument is taken away
	in favor of providing a default security value.

## Wide Character ('Wc'):
	Uses wchar_t or string(s) thereof instead of char.
